    "Such numerical representations are a prerequisite for computational processing, that is, performing calculations, statistical analyses and making predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading this section, you should:\n",

    "## Background: linguistic perspectives on word embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for word embeddings is often attributed to the following observation by the English linguist [J.R. Firth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rupert_Firth):\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What Firth means is that the meaning of a word can be inferred by examining that word in its context of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Martin ([2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.2016.1141939): 45) notes that Firth's interest in the co-occurrences of words, or *collocations*, spawned a wealth of linguistic research, particularly in the field of corpus linguistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firth's observation also resonates with the so-called *distributional hypothesis* proposed by Harris ([1954](https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.1954.11659520)), which posits that linguistic items with similar distributions should have similar meanings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the distributional hypothesis from a linguistic perspective, Magnus Sahlgren ([2008](http://soda.swedish-ict.se/3941/1/sahlgren.distr-hypo.pdf): 33â€“34) points out that:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Proponents of distributional methods often seem comfortable to ascribe meaning to distributional representations without explaining what they _mean_ by meaning. For the non-distributionalist, on the other hand, this will surely seem odd if not completely outrageous, since meaning is usually taken to involve both reference to objects and situations in the world outside language, and to concepts and ideas inside the mind of the language user.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Sahlgren ([2008](http://soda.swedish-ict.se/3941/1/sahlgren.distr-hypo.pdf): 34) argues that the distributional hypothesis has roots in \"structuralist soil\", that is, [Ferdinand de Saussure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdinand_de_Saussure)'s ideas about the structure of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saussure described language from two perspectives: *langue*, the abstract system constituted by language, and *parole*, particular instances of language produced by the underlying system of *langue*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Saussure characterised *langue* as having *paradigmatic* and *syntagmatic* axes of organisation, which allow making choices between alternatives and combining them into larger units. The available choices emerge through oppositions: alternatives can only be identified by what they are and what they are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](img/parasyn.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Saussure's and Firth's ideas were taken further by [M.A.K. Halliday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Halliday), who incorporated them into the foundations of a theory of language known as [systemic functional linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemic_functional_linguistics) (for a recent overview of the field, see Martin [2016](https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.2016.1141939)). \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to Saussure's view of language as a static system of oppositions, Halliday emphasises the role of *choice* for language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Halliday argues that language is defined by *meaning potential*, which is realised *dynamically* by making choices within intersecting linguistic systems. These systems are provided by *lexicogrammar*, which Halliday describes as a cline: the choices made within language become increasingly delicate when moving from grammar to lexis (see e.g. Fontaine [2017](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40554-017-0051-7)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Against this backdrop, we will now turn to explore the distributional hypothesis from both syntagmatic and paradigmatic perspectives."

    "To explore syntagmatic organisations in a corpus of texts, we can build a co-occurrence matrix to examine which words co-occur with each other within some sequence. These sequences may be motivated linguistically, as exemplified by a clause or a sentence, or they may simply consist of words within some distance of one another. \n",
